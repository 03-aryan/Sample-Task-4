# Design for Scaling gRPC Report Generation Service to 10,000 RPS


## Scaling Using Kubernetes

- Deploy multiple stateless service instances as Kubernetes Pods.
- Use Kubernetes Deployments for pod lifecycle management and Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for scaling based on resource usage.
- Stateless design ensures flexible traffic routing and seamless failover.

---

## Load Balancing with NGINX

- Configure NGINX as a gRPC-aware reverse proxy to distribute incoming traffic among the Pods.
- Use health checks for pod availability to prevent routing to failed instances.
- Basic geographic routing can be configured for latency optimization.

## Report Persistence and Storage

- Integrate Redis as a distributed cache to store generated reports persistently.
- Optionally plan to adopt a scalable NoSQL database for durable multi-region storage as the system evolves.

## Observability with Jaeger

- Integrate Jaeger tracing with the gRPC service, as I have done previously, to capture and visualize distributed request flows.
- Tracing will provide valuable insights into latency issues, bottlenecks, and request paths across microservices.
- Jaeger supports root cause analysis and performance optimization at scale.

---

## Reliability & Health Checks

- Use Kubernetes readiness and liveness probes to ensure only healthy Pods serve traffic.
- Implement retry policies with exponential backoff in clients and servers to handle transient errors.
- Monitor system health using logs and simple metrics collection.

---

## Security

- Secure gRPC connections with TLS encryption.

By combining my practical Jaeger experience with foundational Kubernetes and NGINX setups, this plan balances operational simplicity and robust observability, ready to evolve with increasing system complexity.
